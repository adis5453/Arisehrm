## ⚡ **CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### 1. **🚨 CRITICAL: React App Loading Issue - FIXED**

**Problem:** Application showing blank white screen preventing all functionality

**Root Cause Found:**
```tsx
// ❌ BROKEN CODE in /app/frontend/src/components/common/ErrorBoundary.tsx
const ErrorFallback: React.FC<ErrorFallbackProps> = ({ error, errorInfo }) => {
  const navigate = useNavigate() // ← Hook in class component context!
  
  const handleGoHome = () => {
    navigate('/') // ← Violates React Rules of Hooks
  }
```

**Fix Applied:**
```tsx
// ✅ FIXED CODE
const ErrorFallback: React.FC<ErrorFallbackProps> = ({ error, errorInfo }) => {
  // Removed useNavigate hook - using standard JavaScript navigation
  
  const handleGoHome = () => {
    window.location.href = '/' // ← Standard navigation, no hook violation
  }
  
  const handleRefresh = () => {
    window.location.reload() // ← Already correct
  }
```

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/frontend/src/components/common/ErrorBoundary.tsx`
  - Removed `import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom'`
  - Replaced hook-based navigation with standard browser APIs

**Result:** ✅ Application now loads perfectly with professional HRM interface

### 2. **🔧 CSS Build Warning - FIXED**

**Problem:** Tailwind CSS build error: "The border-border class does not exist"

**Root Cause Found:**
```css
/* ❌ BROKEN CODE in /app/frontend/src/index.css */
@layer base {
  * {
    @apply border-border; /* ← Undefined Tailwind class */
  }
}
```

**Fix Applied:**
```css
/* ✅ FIXED CODE */
@layer base {
  * {
    /* Removed problematic border-border class */
  }
  body {
    @apply bg-background text-foreground;
  }
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/frontend/src/index.css` - Removed undefined Tailwind class

**Result:** ✅ CSS builds cleanly without warnings
